Here you can find information about course content, class policies, and resources to support your learning. This is meant to be a relatively static site, meaning it won’t be updated during the semester. For day-to-day information about class activities or assignments, please check our class Moodle page.\nI am looking forward to working with each of you this semester and it is my top priority to support your growth as a learner and to make our time together, both in class and out, productive and engaging. My goal is to create a learning environment where you feel comfortable participating in class as well as coming to me with any questions or concerns that arise, mathematical and otherwise.\nWhile I’ll do everything in my power to support you, your success in this course ultimately depends on you. I ask you to bring a readiness to work and a belief that you can learn. I absolutely believe this about each of you. I will ask you to do tasks that are just at the edge of what you can handle because that is how the best learning happens, but if you are prepared to invest your time and energy, and to communicate with me about how you’re doing, I can and will support you.\nWe will strive in this class to create an environment that values our different perspectives and celebrates the contributions of every person. I promise to be respectful of you and your ideas. No matter your background or identity, you are welcome in this classroom. You belong here!"

    "text": "Course Materials\n\nTextbook\nWe will be using the open source textbook Active Caclulus Single Variable, 2nd Edition by Matthew Boelkins, et al. 2025. This is a free, open-source text available in both online (HTML) and PDF versions:\n\nOnline Version\nPDF Version\n\nI recommend that you use the online version as it will give you access to interactive problems embedded in the text. Note that this text covers both Calc I and Calc II material – we will focus on Chapters 5-8.\nWhile a print version of the 2nd edition is not yet available, there’s no difference between the 1st and 2nd editions for Chapters 5-7, so if you really want a print version, the 1st edition would be fine. To be clear – you do not need a print copy - I mention it just because some students like to have a hard copy of the text. You can order a print version here for about $25 which covers the cost of printing.\n\n\nWorkbook\nAll of the activities from the textbook can also be found bundled in an Activites Workbook for chapters 5-8:\n[AW]: Active Calculus Activities Workbook, chs 5-8, 2nd Ed.\nThese activities are the same as what you’ll find in the textbook, but are formatted with additional white space to make it easier to write and organize your work. It’s not at all necessary that you print these out yourself – but they’re here if you think that might be useful.\nAll additional handouts or course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will also regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check there to see what you missed.\n\n\nTechnology\nI expect that everyone has access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet device. We will make use of the online graphing tool Desmos so if you don’t already have a free Desmos account, I recommend that you sign up for one. It’s not absolutely necessary, but it does allow you to save your work, which is nice. In class, we will often be working in small groups so it’s not necessary for everyone to bring a device to class, but you’ll want to be able to use it outside of class. Note that if you already have a graphing calculator, you may find that useful, but my experience is that Desmos is the better tool for our needs.\nFrom time to time, we may also make use of online tools such as Wolfram Alpha for certain calculations. We will discuss in class when such tools are approprate. Note that GenAI tools such as ChatGPT are not appropriate for doing mathematics. Again, we will discuss why this is throughout the semester.\nFinally, if you need any assistance getting access to technology, please let me know!",

Worse than that, research shows that grades undermine the learning process in several key ways:\nAlthough I am required to submit a grade for each student at the end of the semester, my goal is to de-emphasize the role of grades in this course so that as much as possible our focus is on learning.\nFor this reason, we will focus on qualitative rather than quantitative feedback (i.e. points) to assess your progress in this course. Your understanding of the course material, as assessed in terms of demonstrating proficiency on the stated learning targets, is ultimately what matters.\nYour goal should be to demonstrate proficiency on as many of the learning targets as you can by the end of the semester. I will keep track (and I encourage you to keep track as well) every time you demonstrate proficient level work. The course level learning goals will be assessed primarily through homework reports, AEPs, and other reflective assignments.

You should should consistently demonstrate this deep understanding of the material using a wide variety of methods described above.

You should consistently demonstrate your understanding of the material using some of the methods described above. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating many elements of course engagement as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting most lab assignments\ncompleting both projects\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates an basic understanding of the course material.

    "text": "AI Policy\n\nUsing AI tools such as ChatGPT on homework or other submitted work fundamentally undermines our learning goals and will be considered a violation of UP’s academic integrity policy. If I see work that I suspect may have been produced by or with the help of AI tools I will ask you to redo the assignment. I am also obligated to share my concerns with the Dean of Students.\nFor the reasons articulated below, my strong suggestion is that you don’t use AI tools in any other capacity for this class.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT work by predicting what words will form coherent sentences in the context of the prompt you’ve given it, essentially “autocomplete in overdrive”. Gen AI tools have been described as Bullshit Machines meaning that they are designed to produce output that sounds convincing without any regard to whether its output is actually correct.\nThis also means that they are not actually doing any mathematics. If ChatGPT can do most of your calculus problems its because it was trained on thousands of calculus textbooks (without the author’s permission). This also means that there’s absolutely no promise that any answers you get from generative AI are correct.\nI often hear students say that they use AI as a “study aid” to do things like help explain concepts, to summarize content, or to check their work.\nHere’s the thing – those are all skills that you are here (both in this class and at UP) to develop! Struggling to build your own understanding - to make sense of difficult concepts - is the whole point. Using Gen AI to do these tasks for you, you are giving up opportunities to learn. Don’t undermine your growth as a human learner by looking for shortcuts.\nAnd don’t forget the part where there’s no guarantee that anything an AI chatbot tells you is correct!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy general feelings about AI tools are well represented by this passage from Anthony Moser’s essay “I Am An AI Hater”\n\nCritics have … written thoroughly about the environmental harms, the reinforcement of bias and generation of racist output, the cognitive harms and AI supported suicides, the problems with consent and copyright, the way AI tech companies further the patterns of empire, how it’s a con that enables fraud and disinformation and harassment and surveillance, the exploitation of workers, as an excuse to fire workers and de-skill work, how they don’t actually reason and probability and association are inadequate to the goal of intelligence, how people think it makes them faster when it makes them slower, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a fascist technology rooted in the ideology of supremacy, defined not by its technical features but by its political ones.",

Here are a few reasons behind my thinking…\n\nGenerative AI tools are “Bullshit Machines” in the sense that they are designed to produce output that sounds convincing – without regard to whether their output is true or not. If you’re using an AI tool to help with mathematics, you can’t be certain that the output is correct.\nNow it’s true that all the material in this class has been written down in hundreds (thousands?) of textbooks, which have all been used to train these LLMs. This means that if you’re asking an AI tool about a calculus problem or concept, it most likely will give you correct information. But maybe not, which means you need to still need to check it yourself.\nWhat about using AI tools to help explain a concept or technique that you find confusing? Here’s the problem I see with this – the mental struggle of trying to make sense of a new, hard thing is precisely the point**. If you off-load that, you aren’t really engaging with the material in a way that is going to lead to authentic learning. There is reason that my classes don’t have much lecturing in them – that’s not a great way to learn. Many students think\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the issues pointed at in the quote above, here are some others.\n\nGenerative AI tools are “Bullshit Machines” in the sense that they are designed to produce output that sounds convincing – without regard to whether their output is true or not. This means that if you’re using an AI tool to do mathematics, you can’t be sure that the output is correct.\n\n\n\nGenAI tools are not search engines – don’t use them to look up information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not interested in policing you or participating in a surveillance structure that claims to “detect” AI-produced material\ncreating a hostile dynamic between you and your instructor. College is a time for you to decide who you want to be, how you want to engage the work, and take some degree of control. We will discuss this more in class.\nNote that this AI policy applies only to this course. For your other courses, please follow those professors’ AI policies, which may differ from mine.\n\n\nStudents tell me that they use AI to do “explain” things or check answers. The problem is that LLMs like ChatGPT are explicitly designed to sound authoritative, to sound correct. That doesn’t mean it is correct – so if you’re using AI to explain something you should be asking yourself how you know whether it’s correct.\nQ. What about using AI to brainstorm or summarize ideas?\nA. That’s what your brain is for. Seriously, a significant way in which we can engage with the course content is to embrace the mental struggle of organizing and making sense of ideas. When we use words like “brainstorm” we sometimes think that this isn’t the important part. In fact, it’s a critical step in learning. Offloading\nQ. Can I use AI to check my answers?\nA. How do you know that what your AI-bot tells you is correct? Maybe it is - maybe not.\nI will assume that any work that you submit for this class was generated without the use of GenAI.\n\nCritics have already written thoroughly about the environmental harms, the reinforcement of bias and generation of racist output, the cognitive harms and AI supported suicides, the problems with consent and copyright, the way AI tech companies further the patterns of empire, how it’s a con that enables fraud and disinformation and harassment and surveillance, the exploitation of workers, as an excuse to fire workers and de-skill work, how they don’t actually reason and probability and association are inadequate to the goal of intelligence, how people think it makes them faster when it makes them slower, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a fascist technology rooted in the ideology of supremacy, defined not by its technical features but by its political ones.\n- Anthony Moser, “I Am An AI Hater”"

    "text": "Course Materials\n\nTextbook\nWe will be using the open source textbook Active Caclulus Single Variable, 2nd Edition by Matthew Boelkins, et al. 2025. This is a free, open-source text available in both online (HTML) and PDF versions:\n\nOnline Version\nPDF Version\n\nI recommend that you use the online version as it will give you access to interactive problems embedded in the text. Note that this text covers both Calc I and Calc II material – we will focus on Chapters 5-8.\nWhile a print version of the 2nd edition is not yet available, there’s no difference between the 1st and 2nd editions for Chapters 5-7, so if you really want a print version, the 1st edition would be fine. To be clear – you do not need a print copy - I mention it just because some students like to have a hard copy of the text. You can order a print version here for about $25 which covers the cost of printing.\n\n\nWorkbook\nAll of the activities from the textbook can also be found bundled in an Activites Workbook for chapters 5-8:\n[AW]: Active Calculus Activities Workbook, chs 5-8, 2nd Ed.\nThese activities are the same as what you’ll find in the textbook, but are formatted with additional white space to make it easier to write and organize your work. It’s not at all necessary that you print these out yourself – but they’re here if you think that might be useful.\nAll additional handouts or course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will also regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check there to see what you missed.\n\n\nTechnology\nI expect that everyone has access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet device. We will make use of the online graphing tool Desmos so if you don’t already have a free Desmos account, I recommend that you sign up for one. It’s not absolutely necessary, but it does allow you to save your work, which is nice. In class, we will often be working in small groups so it’s not necessary for everyone to bring a device to class, but you’ll want to be able to use it outside of class. Note that if you already have a graphing calculator, you may find that useful, but my experience is that Desmos is the better tool for our needs.\nFrom time to time, we may also make use of online tools such as Wolfram Alpha for certain calculations. We will discuss in class when such tools are approprate. Note that GenAI tools such as ChatGPT are not appropriate for doing mathematics. Again, we will discuss why this is throughout the semester.\nFinally, if you need any assistance getting access to technology, please let me know!"

They are built using stolen intellectual property using exploitative labor practices and they present severe environmental, economic, and political threats to society.\n\nFrom the standpoint of their impact on learning, there is evidence suggesting that AI use can erode creative and critical thinking skills – the very things you are in this class to cultivate.\n\n\n\nThere is evidence that use of AI facilitates labor exploitation of Global South laborers and risks severe environmental repercussions. Many AI platforms rely on stolen intellectual labor of artists and some platforms are used to engage in sexual harassment and exploitation. Further, in many cases, these AI bots provide incorrect and unreliable information and citations. All of this exploitation for, what Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom calls, “a mid technology. Often, the social and intellectual harms outweigh the positives. It is for these reasons, the use of AI is prohibited in this class.\nI am not interested in policing you or participating in a surveillance structure that claims to “detect” AI-produced material\ncreating a hostile dynamic between you and your instructor. College is a time for you to decide who you want to be, how you want to engage the work, and take some degree of control. We will discuss this more in class.\nThis policy adapted from\nNote that this AI policy applies only to this course. For your other courses, please follow those professors’ AI policies, which may differ from mine.\n\n\nStudents tell me that they use AI to do “explain” things or check answers. The problem is that LLMs like ChatGPT are explicitly designed to sound authoritative, to sound correct. That doesn’t mean it is correct – so if you’re using AI to explain something you should be asking yourself how you know whether it’s correct.\nQ. What about using AI to brainstorm or summarize ideas?\nA. That’s what your brain is for. Seriously, a significant way in which we can engage with the course content is to embrace the mental struggle of organizing and making sense of ideas. When we use words like “brainstorm” we sometimes think that this isn’t the important part. In fact, it’s a critical step in learning. Offloading\nQ. Can I use AI to check my answers?\nA. How do you know that what your AI-bot tells you is correct? Maybe it is - maybe not.\nI will assume that any work that you submit for this class was generated without the use of GenAI.\n\nCritics have already written thoroughly about the environmental harms, the reinforcement of bias and generation of racist output, the cognitive harms and AI supported suicides, the problems with consent and copyright, the way AI tech companies further the patterns of empire, how it’s a con that enables fraud and disinformation and harassment and surveillance, the exploitation of workers, as an excuse to fire workers and de-skill work, how they don’t actually reason and probability and association are inadequate to the goal of intelligence, how people think it makes them faster when it makes them slower, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a fascist technology rooted in the ideology of supremacy, defined not by its technical features but by its political ones."

You might find them helpful as well.\n\nA\n\nThis grade generally indicates superior work that demonstrates a deep understanding of the material such that you could apply the material in unfamiliar or especially complex situations. You should should consistently demonstrate this deep understanding of the material using a wide variety of methods described above. This grade likely includes:\n\n\n\ndemonstrating significant course engagement, including homework, as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\nsuccessfully completing all lab assignments\nsuccessfully completing both projects\n\n\nB\n\nThis grade indicates good work that is eminently satisfactory. You should be able to use and extend this knowledge in many situations although you might have difficulty with particularly challenging or unfamilar problems. You should consistently demonstrate your understanding of the material using some of the methods described above. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating many elements of course engagement as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting most lab assignments\ncompleting both projects\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates an basic understanding of the course material. You should be able to handle most of the more straightforward problems encountered but might struggle with more challenging problems. You might consistently meet only a few of the criteria listed above or else meet several criteria but less often. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating some elements of course engagement as evidence in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting some lab assignments\nattempting at least one project\n\n\nD/F\n\nThese grades represent a fundamental breakdown of expectations. A D represents a meaningful but unsuccessful attempt at earning a C or above. An F represents such a severe lack of engagement, effort, or understanding that there is no evidence of meaningful progress.\n\n+/-\n\nIn discussing your course grade together, we may opt to add a modifier to your grade.\n\n\n\nA \\(\\mathbf{-}\\) modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standards for a particular grade with the exception of one element (engagement, labs, or projects e.g.)\nA \\(\\mathbf{+}\\) modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standards for a particular grade and you’ve met one of the elements for a higher grade.",
