    "text": "Course Materials\n\nTextbook\nWe will be using the open source textbook Active Caclulus Single Variable, 2nd Edition by Matthew Boelkins, et al. 2025. This is a free, open-source text available in both online (HTML) and PDF versions:\n\nOnline Version\nPDF Version\n\nI recommend that you use the online version as it will give you access to interactive problems embedded in the text. Note that this text covers both Calc I and Calc II material – we will focus on Chapters 5-8.\nWhile a print version of the 2nd edition is not yet available, there’s no difference between the 1st and 2nd editions for Chapters 5-7, so if you really want a print version, the 1st edition would be fine. To be clear – you do not need a print copy - I mention it just because some students like to have a hard copy of the text. You can order a print version here for about $25 which covers the cost of printing.\n\n\nWorkbook\nAll of the activities from the textbook can also be found bundled in an Activites Workbook for chapters 5-8:\n[AW]: Active Calculus Activities Workbook, chs 5-8, 2nd Ed.\nThese activities are the same as what you’ll find in the textbook, but are formatted with additional white space to make it easier to write and organize your work. It’s not at all necessary that you print these out yourself – but they’re here if you think that might be useful.\nAll additional handouts or course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will also regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check there to see what you missed.\n\n\nTechnology\nI expect that everyone has access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet device. We will make use of the online graphing tool Desmos so if you don’t already have a free Desmos account, I recommend that you sign up for one. It’s not absolutely necessary, but it does allow you to save your work, which is nice. In class, we will often be working in small groups so it’s not necessary for everyone to bring a device to class, but you’ll want to be able to use it outside of class. Note that if you already have a graphing calculator, you may find that useful, but my experience is that Desmos is the better tool for our needs.\nFrom time to time, we may also make use of online tools such as Wolfram Alpha for certain calculations. We will discuss in class when such tools are approprate. Note that GenAI tools such as ChatGPT are not appropriate for doing mathematics. Again, we will discuss why this is throughout the semester.\nFinally, if you need any assistance getting access to technology, please let me know!"

    "text": "AI Policy\n\nUsing AI tools such as ChatGPT on homework or other submitted work fundamentally undermines our learning goals and will be considered a violation of UP’s academic integrity policy. If I see work that I suspect may have been produced by or with the help of AI tools we will have a conversation about it. Note that I am obligated to share any concerns around academic integrity with the Dean of Students.\nIn addition to work you turn in I strongly suggest, for the reasons articulated below, that you don’t use AI tools in any other capacity for this class.\nThese AI policies apply only to this course. For your other courses, please follow those professors’ AI policies, which may differ from mine.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT work by predicting what words will form coherent sentences in the context of the prompt you’ve given it, essentially “autocomplete in overdrive”. Gen AI tools have been described as Bullshit Machines meaning that they are designed to produce output that sounds convincing without any regard to whether its output is actually correct.\nThis also means that they are not actually doing any mathematics. If ChatGPT can do most of your calculus problems its because it was trained on thousands of calculus textbooks (without the author’s permission). This also means that there’s absolutely no promise that any answers you get from generative AI are correct.\nI often hear students say that they use AI as a “study aid” to do things like help explain concepts, to summarize content, or to check their work.\nHere’s the thing – those are all skills that you are here (both in this class and at UP) to develop! Struggling to build your own understanding - to make sense of difficult concepts - is the whole point. Using Gen AI to do these tasks for you, you are giving up opportunities to learn. Don’t undermine your growth as a human learner by looking for shortcuts.\nAnd don’t forget the part where there’s no guarantee that anything an AI chatbot tells you is correct!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamentally, I believe that the use of AI tools in this class ultimately gets in the way of authentic learning.\nBeyond their use in this class, there are many other reasons why you might be critical about the use of AI tools in general, many of which of are touched upon in this passage from Anthony Moser’s essay “I Am An AI Hater.”\n\nCritics have … written thoroughly about the environmental harms, the reinforcement of bias and generation of racist output, the cognitive harms and AI supported suicides, the problems with consent and copyright, the way AI tech companies further the patterns of empire, how it’s a con that enables fraud and disinformation and harassment and surveillance, the exploitation of workers, as an excuse to fire workers and de-skill work, how they don’t actually reason and probability and association are inadequate to the goal of intelligence, how people think it makes them faster when it makes them slower, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a fascist technology rooted in the ideology of supremacy, defined not by its technical features but by its political ones."

    "text": "So I’m not an expert in how humans learn, but I have been teaching mathematics for more than 25 years so I have some ideas. In my experience (and there is research to back this up) we learn best when we are actively engaged with the process. We need to make mistakes, guesses, conjectures. We need to struggle a bit to make sense of what we’re doing. This is the realm of what some educators call productive discomfort.\nNot only is it okay to be stuck, to be confused, but this is actually to be desired becuase this is what leads to authentic learning.\nMy job is to guide you through that journey - to challenge you just enough that you are in that zone while at the same time, provide guidance when needed so that you’re never overwhelmed.\n“But I don’t want to feel uncomfortable!” I hear you say. Sure, I get it. But I have to ask – why are you here if not to learn, to grow, to challenge yourself? Part of my job is to help create, with your help, a learning environment where you feel safe to make mistakes. So while a well constructed lecture feels comfortable - it’s simply not as effective as constructing your own understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI policy in this class is don’t use it.\nFirst, to clarify – when I refer to AI here, I’m specifically thinking of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT – also known as large language models (LLMs).\nWith regard to the use of AI tools in this course, there are two types of usage we can think of.\nHere are a few reasons behind my thinking…\n\nGenerative AI tools are Bullshit Machines in the sense that they are designed to produce output that sounds convincing – without regard to whether their output is true or not. If you’re using an AI tool to help with mathematics, you can’t be certain that the output is correct.\nNow it’s true that all the material in this class has been written down in hundreds (thousands?) of textbooks, which have all been used to train these LLMs (without their author’s permission). This means that if you’re asking an AI tool about a calculus problem or concept, it most likely will give you correct information. But maybe not, which means you need to still need to check it yourself.\nWhat about using AI tools to help explain a concept or technique that you find confusing? Here’s the problem I see with this – the mental struggle of trying to make sense of a new, hard thing is precisely the point**. If you off-load that, you aren’t really engaging with the material in a way that is going to lead to authentic learning. There is reason that my classes don’t have much lecturing in them – that’s not a great way to learn. Many students think\n\n\nI am not interested in policing you or participating in a surveillance structure that claims to “detect” AI-produced material\ncreating a hostile dynamic between you and your instructor. College is a time for you to decide who you want to be, how you want to engage the work, and take some degree of control. We will discuss this more in class.\nNote that this AI policy applies only to this course. For your other courses, please follow those professors’ AI policies, which may differ from mine.\n\n\nStudents tell me that they use AI to do “explain” things or check answers. The problem is that LLMs like ChatGPT are explicitly designed to sound authoritative, to sound correct. That doesn’t mean it is correct – so if you’re using AI to explain something you should be asking yourself how you know whether it’s correct.\nQ. What about using AI to brainstorm or summarize ideas?\nA. That’s what your brain is for. Seriously, a significant way in which we can engage with the course content is to embrace the mental struggle of organizing and making sense of ideas. When we use words like “brainstorm” we sometimes think that this isn’t the important part. In fact, it’s a critical step in learning. Offloading\nQ. Can I use AI to check my answers?\nA. How do you know that what your AI-bot tells you is correct? Maybe it is - maybe not.\nI will assume that any work that you submit for this class was generated without the use of GenAI.\n\nCritics have already written thoroughly about the environmental harms, the reinforcement of bias and generation of racist output, the cognitive harms and AI supported suicides, the problems with consent and copyright, the way AI tech companies further the patterns of empire, how it’s a con that enables fraud and disinformation and harassment and surveillance, the exploitation of workers, as an excuse to fire workers and de-skill work, how they don’t actually reason and probability and association are inadequate to the goal of intelligence, how people think it makes them faster when it makes them slower, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a fascist technology rooted in the ideology of supremacy, defined not by its technical features but by its political ones.\n- Anthony Moser, “I Am An AI Hater”"

Your goal over the course of the semester is to develop your understanding of these topics and demonstrate that understanding via various assessment tasks – primarily our weekly check-ins. I’ve organized these topics to generally align with our textbook.\n\nEvaluating Integrals\nI1. I can evaluate integrals using substitution and integration by parts methods.\nI2. I can evaluate integrals using additional methods such as partial fractions or trig substitution.\nI3. I can evaluate integrals when the appropriate method is not prescribed and/or when multiple methods are needed.\nI4. I can determine whether improper integrals converge and evaluate them if they do.\n\n\nApplications of Integrals\nA1. I can use definite integrals to find the area of a region enclosed by multiple curves.\nA2. I can use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve.\nA3. I can use definite integrals to find the volume of a solid of revolution.\nA4. I can use definite integrals to find the mass and center of mass of an object.\nA5. I can use definite integrals to represent key quantities in physical applications such as work or pressure.\n\n\nDifferential Equations\nD1. I can determine whether a function is a solution to a differential equation and explain why the function is or is not a solution.\nD2. I can apply Euler’s Method to generate an approximate solution to an initial value problem and explain the result’s meaning in context.\nD3. I can express real world situations as differential equations, determine any stable or unstable equilibrium solutions, and explain the significance of the equilibrium solutions in context.\n\n\nTaylor Polynomials and Series\nT1. I can find the Taylor polynomial for a given function with a specified degree and center.\nT2. I can identify geometric series find their sum if they converge.\nT3. I can use the Taylor series of one or more familiar functions to find the Taylor series for a related function."

Worse than that, research shows that grades undermine the learning process in several key ways:\nAlthough I am required to submit a grade for each student at the end of the semester, my goal is to de-emphasize the role of grades in this course so that as much as possible our focus is on learning.\nFor this reason, we will focus on qualitative rather than quantitative feedback (i.e. points) to assess your progress in this course. Your understanding of the course material, as assessed in terms of demonstrating proficiency on the stated learning targets, is ultimately what matters.\nYour goal should be to demonstrate proficiency on as many of the learning targets as you can by the end of the semester. I will keep track (and I encourage you to keep track as well) every time you demonstrate proficient level work. The course level learning goals will be assessed primarily through homework reports, AEPs, and other reflective assignments. The other, content focused, learning targets primarily through the in-class weekly check-ins."

Unless it becomes a habit, there is no penalty to missing class apart from missing out on that day’s activity. If you do miss class, I expect you to check the class Moodle page to see what we covered that day.\nFinally, if you find yourself missing class more than a few times, you can expect that I will check with you to see how I can support your attendance better."

Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity."
