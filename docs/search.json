    "text": "Course Materials\n\nTextbook\nWe will be using the open source textbook Active Caclulus Single Variable, 2nd Edition by Matthew Boelkins, et al. 2025. This is freely available in both online (HTML) and PDF versions through these links:\n\nOnline Version\nPDF Version\n\nI recommend that you use the Online version as it will give you access to interactive problems embedded in the text.\nNote that the text covers both semesters of Calculus – our class will focus on Chapters 5-8.\nWhile a print version of the 2nd edition is not yet available, for Calc II the only difference betweeen the 1st and 2nd editions is Chapter 8, so if you really want a print version, the 1st edition would be fine for Chapters 5-7. To be clear – you do not need a print copy - I mention it just because some students like to have a hard copy of the text. You can order a print version here for about $25 which covers the cost of printing.\n\n\nWorkbook\nAll of the activities from the textbook can also be found bundled in an Activites Workbook for chapters 5-8:\n[AW]: Active Calculus Activities Workbook, chs 5-8, 2nd Ed.\nThese activities are the same as what you’ll find in the textbook, but are formatted with additional white space to make it easier to write and organize your work. It’s not at all necessary that you print these out yourself – but they’re here if you think that might be useful.\nAll additional handouts or course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will also regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check there to see what you missed.\n\n\nTechnology\nI expect that eveyone has access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet device. We will make extensive use of the online graphing tool Desmos so if you don’t already have a free Desmos account, I suggest that you do that so. It’s not necessary to have an account, but it does allow you to save your work. In class, we will often be working in small groups so it’s not necessary for everyone to bring a device to class, but you’ll want to be able to use it outside of class.\nIf you need any assistance getting access to technology, please let me know!\n\n\nAI Policy\n\n\nCollaboration\nUnless otherwise instructed, I encourage you to work together with classmates on homework or other, although any work that you hand in (unless it’s specified as a group assignment) should be your own.\n\n\nOnline resources (including AI)\nI am well aware that there are many online tools that can do many calculations for you. We will talk extensively about when it’s appropriate to use these tools and when it is not. If you do use any online resources, you should absolutely document that. Be specific about what tools you use and how you use them.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the posted due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances or by prior arrangement, I will not accept work after those dates.\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nMon, Aug. 25: Classes begin\nFri, Aug. 29: Last day to add/drop\nMon, Sep. 1: Labor Day – classes in session, offices closed\nMon-Fri, Oct. 13-17: Fall Break\nMon, Nov 24: Last day to Withdraw\nThur-Fri, Nov 27-28: Thanksgiving\nFri, Dec 5: Last day of classes\nMon, Dec 8: Section B final check-in, 1:30-3:30\nTue, Dec 9: Section A final check-in, 1:30-3:30"

You should should consistently demonstrate this deep understanding of the material using a wide variety of methods described above.

You should be able to use and extend this knowledge in many situations although you might have difficulty with particularly challenging or unfamilar problems. You should consistently demonstrate your understanding of the material using some of the methods described above. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating many elements of course engagement as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting most lab assignments\ncompleting both projects\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates an basic understanding of the course material. You should be able to handle most of the more straightforward problems encountered but might struggle with more challenging problems.

If there is a specific time that you would like to meet and you don’t see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email.\n\n\nOpen Door\nI have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I’ll be available – but you are always welcome to stop by my office at any time. Unless I’m in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.\n\n\nMath Resource Center\nThe MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as scheduled, individualized help. I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester).

Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity."

Students who experience a disability are encouraged to use the services of the Office for Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic Resource Center (503-943- 8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in the course syllabus."
