You should be able to use and extend this knowledge in many situations although you might have difficulty with particularly challenging or unfamilar problems. You should consistently demonstrate your understanding of the material using some of the methods described above. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating many elements of course engagement as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting most lab assignments\ncompleting both projects\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates an basic understanding of the course material.

Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating.

This is freely available in both online (HTML) and PDF versions through these links:\n\nOnline Version\nPDF Version\n\nI recommend that you use the Online version as it will give you access to interactive problems embedded in the text.\nNote that the text covers both semesters of Calculus – our class will focus on Chapters 5-8.\nWhile a print version of the 2nd edition is not yet available, for Calc II the only difference betweeen the 1st and 2nd editions is Chapter 8, so if you really want a print version, the 1st edition would be fine for Chapters 5-7. To be clear – you do not need a print copy - I mention it just because some students like to have a hard copy of the text. You can order a print version here for about $25 which covers the cost of printing.\n\n\nWorkbook\nAll of the activities from the textbook can also be found bundled in an Activites Workbook for chapters 5-8:\n[AW]: Active Calculus Activities Workbook, chs 5-8, 2nd Ed.\nThese activities are the same as what you’ll find in the textbook, but are formatted with additional white space to make it easier to write and organize your work. It’s not at all necessary that you print these out yourself – but they’re here if you think that might be useful.\nAll additional handouts or course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will also regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check there to see what you missed.\n\n\nTechnology\nI expect that eveyone has access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet device. We will make extensive use of the online graphing tool Desmos so if you don’t already have a free Desmos account, I suggest that you do that so. It’s not necessary to have an account, but it does allow you to save your work. In class, we will often be working in small groups so it’s not necessary for everyone to bring a device to class, but you’ll want to be able to use it outside of class.\nIf you need any assistance getting access to technology, please let me know!\n\n\nAI Policy\n\n\nCollaboration\nUnless otherwise instructed, I encourage you to work together with classmates on homework or other, although any work that you hand in (unless it’s specified as a group assignment) should be your own.\n\n\nOnline resources (including AI)\nI am well aware that there are many online tools that can do many calculations for you. We will talk extensively about when it’s appropriate to use these tools and when it is not. If you do use any online resources, you should absolutely document that. Be specific about what tools you use and how you use them.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the posted due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances or by prior arrangement, I will not accept work after those dates.\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nMon, Aug. 25: Classes begin\nFri, Aug. 29: Last day to add/drop\nMon, Sep. 1: Labor Day – classes in session, offices closed\nMon-Fri, Oct. 13-17: Fall Break\nMon, Nov 24: Last day to Withdraw\nThur-Fri, Nov 27-28: Thanksgiving\nFri, Dec 5: Last day of classes (hard deadline for late work)\nMon, Dec 8: Section B final check-in, 1:30-3:30\nTue, Dec 9: Section A final check-in, 1:30-3:30",

I can do three key things from first semester calculus: (a) sketch the derivative function, given a function’s graph; (b) apply the chain rule to find the derivative of a composite function; and (c) apply the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate a definite integral.\n\n\nEvaluating Integrals\nI1. Given the graph of a function and other data, I can construct an accurate graph of the antiderivative of the function by determining select values of the antiderivative as well as where the antiderivative is increasing/decreasing and CCU/CCD.\nI2. I can apply the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the antiderivative of a function in terms of an integral and also use the 2nd FTC to differentiate an integral function.\nI3. I can use integration by substitution and integration by parts to evaluate integrals.\nI4. I can apply an appropriate technique to evaluate or approximate a definite integral.\nI5. I can determine whether improper integrals converge and evaluate them if they do.\n\n\nUsing Definite Integrals\nA1. I can use definite integrals to find the area between two curves.\nA2.*  I can use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve.\nA3. I can use definite integrals to find the volume of a solid of revolution.\nA4.*  I can use definite integrals to find the mass and center of mass of an object.\nA5.*  I can use definite integrals to represent key quantities in physical applications such as work or pressure.\n\n\nDifferential Equations\nD1. I can check whether a function is a solution to a differential equation and explain why the function is or is not a solution.\nD2.*  I can apply Euler’s Method to generate an approximate solution to an initial value problem and explain the result’s meaning in context.\nD3.*  I can express real world situations as differential equations, determine any stable or unstable equilibrium solutions, and explain the significance of the equilibrium solutions in context.\n\n\nTaylor Polynomials and Series\nT1. Given appropriate information about a function, I can find its Taylor polynomials at a given center a.\nT2. I can determine whether or not an infinite series is geometric and, if so (and it converges), find its sum.\nT3. I can use the Taylor series of one or more familiar functions to find the Taylor series for a related function.",

The University Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless of major.\nAs a priority for this Core class, our focus is the ``scientific and quantitative literacy and problem solving’’ habit. As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential and integral calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate solutions in written form.",
