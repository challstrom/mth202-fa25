## Masyu Instructions

-   Finished puzzle will contain a loop made of horizontal/vertical segments that connects all the black and white circles

-   The line thru a white circle must be straight. However, there must be at least one corner made on the dot immediately preceding or immediately following the white circle (or on both dots).

-   The line going thru a black circle must turn a corner on the black circle. Both lines emanating from this corner must go straight through the next dot before making any turns.
