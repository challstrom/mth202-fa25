## MTH 202 Review

What questions did you have?

## Specific Questions

-   How does the **chain rule** work?
-   How does the **quotient rule** work?
-   How do you find a **tangent line**?
-   What is a **Riemann sum**?
    -   or more generally, how do you do #4?
-   Is this algebra move valid?

## General Questions

-   How do you do #1c?
-   How do you do integrals / integration problems?
-   How you remember Calc I formulas?
-   How should I review this stuff??

## What should I remember from Calc I?

In general, I'm not a fan of memorization. But...

. . .

there are basic facts that come up often enough that you should probably know them without looking up

## Derivatives

-   Derivatives of basic functions like $x^n$, $e^x$, $\sin(x)$, etc.
-   Product, quotient, chain rules
-   Derivatives are slopes of tangent lines
-   Derivatives are rates of change

(this list is not exhaustive)

## Integrals and Antiderivatives



$$
\int x^2 \, dx
$$

. . .

This is an **indefinite integral** aka an **anti-derivative**:

Find the function(s) whose derivative is $x^2$

. . .

$$ 
\frac{1}{3} x^3 + C 
$$


## Example 2

$$
\int_{-1}^3 x^2 \, dx
$$

. . .


::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"} 

This is a **definite** integral. Can represent area under a graph.

::: {.column width="50%"} 

![](./area.png){.absolute right="0" width="400"}

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (the second one)



$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$ where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$

. . . 

So... 

$$
\int_{-1}^3 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 \, \Bigg \rvert_{-1}^3 = \frac{1}{3}27 - \frac{1}{3}(-1) = \frac{28}{3}
$$
