# Welcome Back!

## Homework

::: incremental
-   Hand in report & **one** solution only <br> (unless otherwise instructed)

-   Homework is practice! If doing or completeing a particular problem is not productive, **don't do it!**.

-   I expect that you will check your answers with the textbook when possible.

-   Questions are great! But know that I usually can't answer -- unless with a short comment. Bring them to office hours!
:::

## Check-Ins

-   One note card/sheet only - no class notes or textbook.

## AEP

-   Need BOTH correct (mostly) solutions AND clear, complete explanations!

-   Marked on EMRI scale

    -   E: exceeds expectations
    -   M: meets expectations
    -   R: needs revisions
    -   I: incomplete (may not resubmit)

- E or M counts as *completed*
